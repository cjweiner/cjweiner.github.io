            <p>
                A Software Developer, Gamer and Maker. I was born and raised in Western Massachusetts. I attended <a href="http://champlain.edu">Champlain College</a> in Burlington VT where I graduated in 2012 with a Bachelors in Game Programming. I have been doing this software development thing now for seven years.

                When I'm not at work I am working on side projects. Outside of programming I love to enjoy a good beer and catch a game of hockey on the TV. If I'm not watching hockey or tinkering with a side project I'm likely gaming: FPS, Strategy, or even just a casual Puzzler, I enjoy them all.
            </P>

                I am passionate about my craft and put pride into the work I do. I strive to do the best job I can and make sure that what I have finished is of a high quality, but at the same time I know when to "ship it". I pride my self with the ability to learn quickly and jump into a project.
            </P>
