Hello and welcome,

My name is Corey Weiner and I am a gamer, software developer, and maker.
I started this blog with the intent to have a place to store my ideas, thoughts,
and musings on topics ranging from life to software development to video games.

My intent is for this blog to be used as a way to collect my thoughts and muses on things
related to any number of topics, hence the name Live Laugh Code.
I hope that this blog will capture my personality and give a better insight into who I am.

In my day-to-day I use the full Microsoft stack to develop web applications. When not working
I try to get my hands on as many new technologies as I can. Recently I have been playing
around with node and express with an idea to run a web app as an interface for a
Raspberry Pi home server (more on this later). When I am not developing or looking into new
tech I can usual be found playing video games or board games.

If you'd like to reach out, feel free to send me an email or hit me up on twitter.I hope you will
join me for the ride on this blog
