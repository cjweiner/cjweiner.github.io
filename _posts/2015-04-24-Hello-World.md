Hello and welcome,

My name is Corey Weiner and I am a gamer, software developer, and maker.
I started this blog with the intent to have a place to store my ideas, thoughts,
and musings on a variety of topics ranging from life to software development to video games. 
This is the reasoning behind the name of this blog, *Live, Laugh, Code!*

This blog is something that I have been wanting to do for a while and has been one of my many 
side projects that I have tried to finish throughout the years. I made a resolution to my self 
that I would try and finish or at least put in 80% of the work to finish these side projects.

In my day-to-day I use the full Microsoft stack to develop web applications. When not working
I try to get my hands on as many new technologies as I can. Recently I have been playing
around with node and express with an idea to run a web app as an interface for a
Raspberry Pi home server (more on this later). When I am not developing or looking into new
tech. I can usual be found playing video games, board games or tabletop RPGs. 

To learn a little bit more about me check out my [about page](/about). If you'd like to reach 
out, connect with me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/cjweiner).

I hope you will join me for the ride and thank you for reading,

-Corey
